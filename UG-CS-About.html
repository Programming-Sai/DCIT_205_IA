                <p>
                This is the Information Technology age 
                and at its core is Computer Science. The 
                study of computer science is therefore 
                critical if society is to take full 
                advantage of the benefits Information 
                Technology has to offer and make rapid 
                economic advances. Computer science involves the
                study and development of applications that allow 
                for our everyday use of computers, the software 
                systems that support these applications, and the 
                means and methods used to produce both 
                applications and systems that behave reliably,
                correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer 
                Science lies the skill of computer programming 
                and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect 
                adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound 
                engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.
                <br><br>
                The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them
                to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing 
                industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to 
                bring specialist skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for further study or 
                research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of 
                research in Computer Science.
                <br><br>
                The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
                Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information 
                Technology.
